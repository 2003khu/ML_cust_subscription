# ML_cust_subscription
Project Overview

This project analyzes customer app behavior data to predict and direct customers toward subscriptions. Using machine learning techniques, it identifies patterns in user activity that correlate with subscription likelihood.

Dataset

FineTech_appData.csv: Raw app usage data.

clean_FineTech_appData.csv: Preprocessed version of the dataset.

top_screens.csv: List of app screens used in analysis.
